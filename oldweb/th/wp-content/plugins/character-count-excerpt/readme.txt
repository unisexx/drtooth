Generate automated excerpts using character count instead of word count. New Reading setting to specify length.

== Description ==

By default, WordPress trims excerpts by word count (55 words by default). This plug-in allows you to trim by a maximum 
character count instead. All of the usual filters apply; developers can also modify the character count using a new
`character_count_excerpt_length` filter. Non-developers can now easily change the excerpt length using a new option on 
the Reading settings pages.

The default character length is 300.

== Installation ==

1. Install easily with the WordPress plugin control panel or manually download the plugin and upload the extracted
folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
